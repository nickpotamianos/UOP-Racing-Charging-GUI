## Overview

The **UoP Racing CAN Interface** is a graphical user interface designed to monitor and log the status of a racing carâ€™s battery management system (BMS). It is an integral tool for ensuring safety during charging of the car, providing real-time data acquisition from the CAN system via a Teensy microcontroller.

## Features

- **Console Section:**  
  Facilitates control over the system with buttons for viewing BMS flags and accessing detailed views for voltages and temperatures.

- **Indicator Lights:**  
  Provide status information about the serial connection, battery online status, and battery charging condition.

- **Received Messages Area:**  
  Displays timestamped voltage and temperature readings from the CAN interface, providing essential diagnostic information.

- **Panels:**
  - **Charge:**  
    Shows the state of charge (SOC), voltage, and current, along with a graphical representation of SOC.
  
  - **General:**  
    Displays the rate of energy consumption and indicates bad cells and thermistors if present.
  
  - **Cell Voltages:**  
    Provides the highest, average, and lowest cell voltages.
  
  - **Cell Temperatures:**  
    Shows the highest, average, and lowest cell temperatures.
  
  - **IVT Data:**  
    Lists voltage, current, and accumulated charge.

- **Device Selection:**  
  Enables the user to select, refresh, open, and close the COM port connection and extract logs.

- **Baud Rate Selection:**  
  Allows setting the communication rate for the serial interface.

## Detailed Views

### Voltage Details

Accessible via the "Voltage Details" button, the detailed voltage view offers in-depth insight into individual cell voltages across 12 slaves, each containing 12 cells. The application ensures that voltage levels are within safe operating limits.


### Temperature Details

The "Temperature Details" window, activated through a dedicated button, provides temperature readings from 12 slaves. It monitors temperatures to prevent thermal runaway conditions, ensuring the battery pack operates within safe temperature ranges.


### BMS Flags

When clicking on "BMS Flags," the application presents a separate window that outlines the status of various BMS conditions, encoded in a binary string and visually represented by red and green indicators. It alerts users to any abnormal conditions that may require attention.

## Logging Functionality

The application features robust logging capabilities. It can extract and save logs of the received data, enabling post-operation analysis and historical data review. This is crucial for troubleshooting and performance optimization. It also offers an automatic creation of a `logs` folder inside the application directory, where the context of the received messages window will be parsed, and only the temperatures and voltage values will be stored in a `.csv` file.

## Connectivity

The system establishes communication via a serial connection, with selectable COM ports and configurable baud rates (9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400) to ensure compatibility with different hardware setups.

## Safety and Diagnostics

The application is equipped with numerous safety features, including:

- Real-time monitoring of battery voltage and temperature.
- Immediate display of BMS flags upon detection of anomalies.
- Logging functionality for post-race analysis and diagnostics.
- Automatic logging of the temperature and voltage values upon closing the application.

## Interface Design

The interface design is user-friendly, with logically organized data and control elements. It offers a balance between comprehensive data presentation and ease of use, which is vital for fast-paced racing environments.
